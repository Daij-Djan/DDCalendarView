# DDCalendarView
-   a calendar view that looks like the ical view. It supports drag and drop
- the 2 demos (objc and swift) show to use &amp; customise it
- it can easy be used to show and modify EKEvents - ios native calendar store and can be combined with EventKitUI
- The view can be used for storyboarding and is IBDesignable and also partly IBInspectable so you can 'preview' it in IB
- The view has extensive delegate & dataSource support so it feels like working with UITableViews.
Have fun and please share additions you make

# demo at cocoacontrols
