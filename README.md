# DDCalendarView
a calendar view that looks like the ical view. It supports drag and drop and the 2 demos show to use &amp; customise it

it can easy be used to show and modify EKEvents - ios native calendar store and can be combined with EventKitUI

The view can be used for storyboarding and is IBDesignable and also partly IBInspectable so you can 'preview' it in IB

Have fun and please share additions you make
